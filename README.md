# Reactive-JSON-DB

A self-hosted JSON file database that is reactive similar to Firestore. The project was born from a frustration with the currently available options. Most self-hosted solutions require Docker which can be a pain to set up and or use. This will solve that because this package will have a smaller footprint and only require node.   

The final intended usage will be as an NPM package. I would love the ability to use on the front end with indexDB and/or localStorage.

##TODO:
